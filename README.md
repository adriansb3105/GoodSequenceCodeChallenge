# GoodSequenceCodeChallenge

There are N towers. The height of the ith tower is Hi. A sequence of towers is Good if there are not any two adjacent towers that have the same heights. i.e. for every i (2 <= i <= N) Hi-1 != Hi condition must hold.
You can increase the height of ith tower but it will cost Mi, to increase the height by 1.
Find the minimum cost to make the sequence good.

Start with:
```bash
npm start
